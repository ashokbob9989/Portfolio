    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <div class="about-journey">
        <section class="about-block origin">
            <h4>Roots and Early Life</h4>
            <p>
                I was born and brought up in Jangaon, Telangana (506302), in a farming family where discipline,
                resilience, and perseverance were part of daily life. Growing up in an agrarian household shaped my
                outlook early, teaching me the value of consistent effort and grounded thinking.

        <section class="about-block schooling">
            <h4>Schooling and Foundation</h4>
            <p>
                I completed my education up to Class XII through government welfare institutions, including Tribal
                Welfare and Social Welfare schools. These institutions provided not only academic support but also a
                structured environment that emphasized responsibility and self-discipline.

        <section class="about-block turning-point">
            <h4>The Turning Point</h4>
            <p>
                During my higher secondary education, one of my physics lecturers played a pivotal role in my academic
                journey. His mentorship helped me understand the rigor and mindset required to prepare for competitive
                examinations such as IIT JEE Main and Advanced, and it was here that my approach to learning became more
                focused and goal-driven.

        <section class="about-block self-study">
            <h4>Self-Study and Determination</h4>
            <p>
                With limited resources, I relied heavily on self-study, borrowing books from friends and building my
                preparation independently. This phase strengthened my ability to learn autonomously, manage time
                effectively, and remain consistent under constraints.

        <section class="about-block decision">
            <h4>Choosing the Right Path</h4>
            <p>
                Driven by a strong interest in Computer Science and Engineering, I made a conscious decision to
                prioritize my domain of interest over institutional branding. I chose NIT Durgapur for CSE, even when
                IIT options were available in non-CSE disciplines, believing that depth in the right field mattered
                most.

        <section class="about-block programming">
            <h4>Programming as a Discipline</h4>
            <p>
                At NIT Durgapur, programming became more than an academic requirement—it became a discipline I pursued
                with the intensity of a sport. I actively participated in competitive programming contests and
                consistently upsolved problems to improve precision, speed, and decision-making under pressure.

        <section class="about-block competitions">
            <h4>Competitive Programming Journey</h4>
            <p>
                I regularly competed on platforms such as CodeChef, Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank, LeetCode, and
                Google Kick Start. These experiences sharpened my algorithmic thinking and helped me build a strong
                problem-solving mindset.

        <section class="about-block community">
            <h4>Leadership and Community</h4>
            <p>
                One of my proudest achievements in college was being selected as a community contributor for RECursion,
                the official programming community of NIT Durgapur. With only 10-15 contributors selected, this role
                allowed me to mentor peers, contribute to community initiatives, and strengthen the coding culture on
                campus.

        <section class="about-block industry">
            <h4>Industry Transition</h4>
            <p>
                These cumulative experiences prepared me for real-world software development, leading to internships and
                eventually my current role as a full-time Software Engineer at <span
                    style="color: #48cae4; font-style: italic;">The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY)</span>. Today,
                I work on building reliable and scalable software systems while continuously refining my technical and
                professional skills.
